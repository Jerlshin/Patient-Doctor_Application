# Node.js dependencies: Huge and regenerated on install

# Operating System specific files

# 2. MACHINE LEARNING / WEIGHTS / LARGE FILES
################################

# LARGE MODEL WEIGHTS: These are the files you specifically want to exclude due to size.
# They should be managed via Git LFS if you absolutely need to track them, 
# but ignoring them is the safest approach for pure git.

# Checkpoints/Trained States (e.g., 2.5G)
Backend/checkpoints/

# Safetensors files (e.g., 1.6G, 1.6G, 419M)
**/*.safetensors

# Pickled models/sessions (e.g., QA_Model_cpu.pkl, ses.pkl)
*.pkl

# Generic weights/model files
*.pth
*.bin

# Other potential model file types if you add them later
*.h5
*.onnx

################################
# 3. BACKEND SPECIFIC
################################

# If your 'uploads' directory is for user-uploaded files (which it likely is)
Backend/uploads/

# Temporary MongoDB socket file
/tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
